             <h3>Week 1</h3>

             <p>
            Our task in the first week was to create a blog, and the result of this weeks work is the blog that you are reading right now!. This will be a permanent record of our work over the next eight weeks. We will use it to share with each other and to showcase Founders and Coders to the world.
             </p>
             <p> 
             In order to complete this project, we had to get familiar with a very wide range of environments, languages and tools. our task was to identify how they all fit together, to divide the work up between us, record your efforts, and to complete the task.
             </p>
              <p>On this blog you will see profiles of each of our group members and links to linkedin, github and codewars accounts</p>
